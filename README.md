# Dynamics-and-Control-I
Dynamics and Control I Homework with MATLAB ðŸ› ðŸ“‹


Homewroks based on a lecture given by MIT.

Mainly concentrated on numerical methods and using MATLABÂ® to solve dynamics and vibrations problems.

I like the way he teaches the class, especially how he introduced the Magical formula:

![\Large \frac{^{\mathbf{A}} d \mathbf{v}}{dt} = \frac{^{\mathbf{B}} d \mathbf{v}}{dt} + ^{\mathbf{A}}\mathbf{\omega}^{\mathbf{B}} \times \mathbf{v}]
